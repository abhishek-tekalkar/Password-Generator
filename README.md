Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

#This Password Generator app is a dynamic tool that allows users to effortlessly create secure passwords with adjustable length, and the option to include or exclude numbers and special characters. With a smooth, intuitive interface, users can easily toggle these features and instantly see the changes reflected in the generated password.
